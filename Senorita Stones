Senorita likes stones very much. As she is fond of collecting beautiful stones, everyday she finds some of the stones beautiful and collects it in her bottle.
You are given the number of stones, she collects each day for N numbers of days, starting from the very first day.
Now you are given Q queries, in each query her friend Shangavi asks you the number of days she has taken to collect M number of stones. 
Please note that each query contains the different number of M.
