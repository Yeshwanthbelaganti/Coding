In this problem, we define "set" is a collection of distinct numbers. For two sets A and B, we define their sum set is a set S(A,B)={a+b|a belongs to A,b belongs to B} . 
In other word, set S(A,B) contains all elements which can be represented as sum of an element in A and an element in B.
Given two sets A,C your task is to find set of positive integers less than or equals 100 with maximum size such that S(A,B)=C . 
It is guaranteed that there is unique such set.
