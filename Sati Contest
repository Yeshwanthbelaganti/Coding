Sati has been invited to a give away contest. 
She is left standing in front of two simultaneously moving conveyor belts with N items of different worth placed on each of them and all she has to do is collect items resulting to maximum sum.
The conveyor belts are given in the form of two arrays of size N each and due to the moving belts, 
for an index i she can only pick one item from the two and after that she cannot pick from any index j < i. 
But, remember she can pick any number of items from the same belt but as she picks an item from other there is a penalty of worth X. 
Help her maximize her profit....... For better understanding do have a look on the sample test case.

# You are using Python
n,x=map(int,input().split())
l1=list(map(int,input().split()))
l2=list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in range(1,n):
    l1[i]=max(l1[i-1]+l1[i],l2[i-1]+l1[i]-x)
    l2[i]=max(l2[i-1]+l2[i],l1[i-1]+l2[i]-x)
print(max(l1[-1],l2[-1]))
