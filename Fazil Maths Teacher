Fazil is a maths teacher. Due to aryabhatta's birthday, he has given innovative problems to students for solving. 
One of the problem is, he will give a number(N>0) and students wants to find the number of different ways in which N can be written as a sum of at two or more positive integers.
For Ex:
If N=5
The output is 6
Possible ways are:-
4 + 1
3 + 2
3 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 +1
2 + 1 +1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
----------------------------------
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int countWays(int n)
{
    int table[n+1];
    memset(table,0,sizeof(table));
    table[0]=1;
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
        for(int j=i;j<=n;j++)
        {
            table[j]+=table[j-i];
        }
    return table[n];
}
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    cout<<countWays(n);
    return 0;
}
