One day Benny was walking and realized that her life was boring. Everything was grey, even roads in the best park were grey.
Therefore she decided to make roads a little bit brighter. She know that every road in the park is a segment laying on the X axis with coordinates Xl, Xr (Xl â‰¤ Xr). 
Roads may intersect or overlap.
She chooses any subset of roads and paints them in red. After that she wants to get one continuous red segment. 
As she really likes number L the length of this segment has to be equal to L.
Your task is to determine if it is possible to choose some subset of roads and paint them to get one red segment with the length equal to L?
If it's possible print in a single line "Yes"(without quotes), otherwise print "No" (without quotes).

    ans.sort()
    for j in range(N):
        ft=ans[j][0]+L
        nt=ans[j][1]
        for k in range(j+1,N):
            if ans[k][0]  <= nt and ans[k][1] <= ft:
                nt=max(nt,ans[k][1])
        if nt==ft:
            print("Yes")
            break
    else:
        print("No")
