Hemanth's is a problem solver. 
one day he saw a interesting problem in a newspaper that a person is having a rope of length n meters, you have to cut the rope in different parts of integer in a way that maximizes product of length of all parts. 
Consider that the length of rope is more than 2 meters.(Note: You must cut at least one cut.)
For Ex: N=10,
Output : 36 (The rope length is cut into size of 4,3 and 3, so, the product is 4*3*3 =36)

// You are using GCC
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int max(int a,int b)
{
    return (a>b)?a:b;
}
int max(int a,int b,int c)
{
    return max(a,max(b,c));
}
int maxProd(int n)
{
    if(n==0||n==1)
        return 0;
    int max_val=0;
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
        max_val=max(max_val,i*(n-i),maxProd(n-i)*i);
    return max_val;
}
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    cout<<maxProd(n);
    return 0;
}
