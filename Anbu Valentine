Anbu wants to make this Valentine special for Disha. So, he wants to collect maximum number of roses. 
Help him to collect maximum number of roses. 
Roses are kept in boxes and the boxes are further arranged in an NÃ—M grid.
Anbu can pick a box and get all the roses it contains, but the hack is that if you choose a box, the box immediately below it cannot be selected.
So, help him collect the maximum number of Roses.
