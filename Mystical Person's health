In a mystical TimeLand, a person's health and wealth is measured in terms of time(seconds) left. Suppose a person there has 24x60x60 = 86400 seconds left, 
then he would live for another 1 day. A person dies when his time left becomes 0. Some time-amount can be borrowed from other person, or time-banks. 
Some time-amount can also be lend to another person, or can be used to buy stuffs.
Our hero Mr X, is in critical condition, has very less time left.
Today's the inaugural day of a new time-bank. So they are giving away free time-amount worth 1000 years.
Bank released N slips, A[1], A[2], .... A[N]. Each slip has a time-amount(can be +ve as well as -ve).
A person can pick any number of slips(even none, or all of them, or some of them) out of the N slips. 
But bank introduced a restriction, they announced one more number K. Restriction is that, if a person picks a slip A[i], 
then the next slip that he can choose to pick will be A[i+K+1]. It means there should be a difference of atleast K between the indices of slips picked.
Now slip(s) should be picked in such a way that their sum results in maximum positive time-amount sum possible with the given restriction.
If you predict the maximum positive sum possible, then you win.
Mr X has asked for your help. Help him win the lottery, and make it quick!
