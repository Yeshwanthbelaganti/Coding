Karthick and his friends are playing Cops and Robbers game. They are playing with a grid of size NÃ—N with the below rules.

Each cell in the grid contains either a Cop(P) or a Robber(T).
A cop can only catch a robber if both of them are in the same row.
Each cop can only catch one robber.
A cop cannot catch a robber who is more than K units away from the cop.
Karthick's sister is watching this game and she writes a program to find the maximum number of robbers that can be caught in the grid. So she asked her brother Karthick to explain the game with an example.
Karthic said, if,
Total Robbers = 5
Number of robbers reachable by Cop in Row 1 = 1
Number of robbers reachable by Cop in Row 2 = 2
Number of robbers reachable by Cop in Row 3 = 1
However, one cop can catch at most 1 robber. Hence, in Row 2, only 1 robber is catchable.
Therefore, the 3 robbers can be caught in total.
