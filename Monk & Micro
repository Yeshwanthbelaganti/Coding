Monk and his friend Micro are on a quest to find the answer of Life, Universe and Everything.
In order to complete it they need to answer Q queries on an array A having N integers. The queries can be of following two types:
0 x: Find the number of numbers in A which are not less than x.
1 x: Find the number of numbers in A which are greater than x.
Help them complete the quest and be back in time for the next Code Monk Challenge.
